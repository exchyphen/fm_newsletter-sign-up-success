## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

### What I learned

Practice with React. Learned how to customize ul and li elements further. Initially used list-style-image, but this was a bit too rigid for the design and I ended up using background-image and some positioning using padding/margin.
